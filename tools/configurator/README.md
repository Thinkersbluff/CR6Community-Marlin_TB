## üì¶ Setup Instructions

1. Download the ZIP file from the repository
2. Extract it to a folder of your choice

> üìÅ **Default path after extracting the ZIP:**

## üß∞ What Else You‚Äôll Need
Before you run the Configurator, your computer needs a few helpers installed:
- **Python 3** ‚Äì a free tool that runs the Configurator
- ***Tkinter** ‚Äì lets Python show windows and buttons (included with most Python installations.)
- **PlatformIO** ‚Äì builds the Marlin firmware for your printer
> üß† ***A nod to the nerds:**  
> The GUI toolkit formerly known as `Tkinter` (capital T in Python 2) now lives on as `tkinter` (lowercase) in Python 3.  
> Same toolkit, new casing.

If you‚Äôve never installed anything like this before, don‚Äôt worry. Choose your operating system below and follow the steps.

<summary><strong>ü™ü Windows</strong></summary>


### Step-by-step Instructions
1. Download Python 3 from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer.  **Important:** On the first screen, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
3. Proceed with the installation. On the "Optional Features" screen, ensure that "tcl/tk and IDLE" is selected (this installs Tkinter).
4. After installation, open the Command Prompt (Windows+R, type cmd) and type this into the Command window:
   ```sh
   python --version
   ```
   You should see a confirmation appear in the Command Window showing the version of python that is now installed.

   Now type:
   ```sh
   python -m tkinter
   ```
   If a small window appears, Tkinter is working. If you get an error, rerun the installer and make sure "tcl/tk and IDLE" is checked.

5. (Optional) If you use VS Code, install the Python extension for best experience.

### Troubleshooting
- If you see `ImportError: No module named '_tkinter'`, rerun the Python installer and select "Modify", then ensure "tcl/tk and IDLE" is checked.
- If `python` is not recognized, you may need to add Python to your PATH manually or use `py` instead of `python`.

<summary><strong>üçè macOS</strong></summary>

### Prerequisites
- Python 3 (pre-installed on most recent macOS versions)
- Tkinter (included with Python)

### Step-by-step Instructions
1. Open Terminal.
2. Check your Python version:
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   python3 -m tkinter
   ```
   If a small window appears, Tkinter is working. If not, install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. If you use Homebrew, you can also install Python 3 with:
   ```sh
   brew install python3
   ```

### Troubleshooting
- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'`, try reinstalling Python from python.org, as some Homebrew builds may lack Tkinter.

<summary><strong>üêß Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)</strong></summary>

### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Tkinter (may require separate package)

### Step-by-step Instructions
1. Open Terminal.
2. Update your package list:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   ```
3. Install Python 3 and Tkinter:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install python3 python3-tk
   ```
4. Check installation:
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   python3 -m tkinter
   ```
   If a small window appears, Tkinter is working.

### Troubleshooting
- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'`, make sure you installed `python3-tk`.
- On other distributions, the package name may be `tk` or `tkinter`.
