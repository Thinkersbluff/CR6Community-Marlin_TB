The Marlin Configurator app runs on python.
The files in this EXECUTABLES folder have been "compiled" into executable versions, bundled with the files and binaries required to work.
If you are not able to run "python configurator.py" in a terminal window, from the /tools/configurator folder, you can copy the executable for your operating system to that folder and run the executable instead.
