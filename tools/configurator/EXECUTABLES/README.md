The Marlin Configurator app runs on python.
The files in this EXECUTABLES folder have been "compiled" into executable versions, bundled with the files and binaries required to work.
If you are not able to run "python configurator.py" in a terminal window, from the /tools/configurator folder, you can copy the executable for your operating system to that folder and run the executable instead.

NOTE: Good ol' Windows Defender and Norton Anti-Virus (and probably others) may decide that the configurator.exe file must be infected and will quarantine it, maybe before you even get it downloaded. <sigh>   I cannot afford to purchase a certificate to sign this code, so you will either have to trust me or not...
