Background:

The configurator app gui is not displaying correctly.

I have no prior knowledge of the Tkinter app, but ChatGPT4.1 happily set me up with a gui based on this.  As the app got more and more complete, however, it looks like ChatGPT4.1 ran out of capacity (memory?, complexity?) to maintain and build this app.  I was not keeping backups (what?) because the app was not working the way I wanted it to, then suddently ChatGPT had wiped-out (omitted) great chunks of the program.

I have slowly reconstructed and modified the program, but ChatGPT4.1 has persistently made multiple errors per edit and seems to have hit a capability limit that forces me to figure the last part out by myself. (or wait for Claude Sonnet 4 or ChatGPT 5 to become available to me again in September.)

This is a record of my stubborn attempt to understand and fix the code myself.

# The GUI code

Configurator.py is a python program, intended to be platform agnostic, but developed and tested exclusively on Linux Mint 22.1, so far.

This is a link to the python tkinter documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html

Key tkinter rules for GUI design include:
 - Define the element before you Pack the element

The Configurator GUI is designed to present the following elements to the User;

1. An application window (main frame)

This is an analysis of the current code:

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk, filedialog, messagebox, simpledialog

; The above imports tkinter, with the alias tk
; (tkinter is installed with python, to support gui applications like this)
; Then it imports the following tkinter widget functions: ttk, filedialog, messagebox, and simpledialog

# Themed Tk (ttk) 
ttk is a family of Tk widgets that provide a much better appearance on different platforms than many of the classic Tk widgets

In this app, the ttk Combobox widget is used as a combination button/picklist widget, in two places:
  
1. To select the target platform config example folder:
    self.example_menu = ttk.Combobox(self.picklist_frame, textvariable=self.selected_example, values=example_folders, state='readonly')

2. To select the objective flashcard:
    self.objective_menu = ttk.Combobox(self.flash_frame, textvariable=self.selected_objective, values=objectives, state='readonly')

# filedialog

The filedialog widget allows the user to browse to the directory and file of their choice, and it can be configured to open at a specific starting place.

In Configurator.py, filedialog is used in two places:

1. The Load... (load_other_file) button allows a user to select any file for importing into the Configurator editor textarea:

    def load_other_file(self):
        '''Load a different configuration file.'''
        logging.info('load_other_file called')
        file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(
            title='Load Configuration File',
            filetypes=[('Header Files', '*.h'), ('All Files', '*.*')],
            initialdir=os.path.dirname(MARLIN_CONFIG_PATH)

2. The Save button offers a SaveAs alternative (save_as_c   onfig), if the user does not wish to overwrite the base Configuration.h file with their edits:

    def save_as_config(self):
        '''Save changes to a new configuration file/location.'''
        logging.info('save_as_config called')
        file_path = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(
            title='Save Configuration As...',
            defaultextension='.h',
            filetypes=[('Header Files', '*.h'), ('All Files', '*.*')],
            initialdir=os.path.dirname(MARLIN_CONFIG_PATH),
            initialfile='Configuration.h'

# messagebox

The messagebox widget presents a popup box with an error message, on programmed events (e.g. error messages when user-requested actions fail)

This widget is used at least 14 times in the Configurator app:
1. If copy platformio-environment.txt value to platformio.ini does not find the source or target:
        if not folder or not os.path.isfile(env_file):
            messagebox.showerror('Error', 'No example environment value found.')
            return

2. If the above succeeds:
    messagebox.showinfo('Copied', f'platformio.ini updated with env: {env_value}')

3. If there is an error while effecting the above copying action:
        except Exception as e:
            messagebox.showerror('Error', f'Failed to copy env: {e}')
        self.update_default_envs_label()

4. If an attempt to load the base configuration file into the editor fails;
    messagebox.showerror('Error', f'Failed to load: {e}')

5. If an attempt to load the example configuration file into the editor is made before first selecting the target printer example configuration;
    if not current_example or current_example not in example_folders:
        messagebox.showwarning('Select Example', 'Please select a printer configuration example before loading an example config.')

6. If the load example configuration file function is somehow directed to a non-existent folder (e.g. the folder has been deleted):
elif folder:
    messagebox.showerror('Error', f'Example folder not found: {folder}')

7. To ask the User whether to overwrite the base config file with their changes or whether to offer a filedialog so that they can SaveAs elsewhere:
    result = messagebox.askquestion('Save', 'Update base file (Marlin/Configuration.h)?\nChoose No to Save As elsewhere.', icon='question')
    if result == 'yes':
        self.save_base_config()
    else:
        self.save_as_config()

8. To confirm a successful base configuration file save:
    messagebox.showinfo('Saved', f'Base configuration updated: {MARLIN_CONFIG_PATH}')

9. To announce an error encountered when trying to overwrite the base configuration file:
    except Exception as e:
        messagebox.showerror('Error', f'Failed to save: {e}')

10. To announce the app can not overwrite the ./config/example files, if the user tries to SaveAs into one of those folders:
 if file_path_abs.startswith(config_dir_abs):
    messagebox.showerror('Error', 'Cannot overwrite example config files.')

11. To confirm a successful SaveAs operation:
    messagebox.showinfo('Saved', f'Configuration saved as {file_path}')

12. To report a failed SaveAs operation:
        except Exception as e:
            messagebox.showerror('Error', f'Failed to save: {e}')

13. To tell the user they must select a configuration example folder, before they can use the Load Base button:
    if not selected:
        messagebox.showwarning('Select Example', 'Please select a printer configuration example before loading the base config.')

14. To announce a failure to load the base configuation:
    except Exception as e:
        messagebox.showerror('Error', f'Failed to load base config: {e}')

# simpledialog

The simpledialog widget prompts a user to enter a value, and offers a default value to accept with "Enter."

In this app, the simpledialog widget is used to prompt the user after they select Load Example.  It offers the currently selected ./config/example folder as default, but will allow the user to enter their own alternative (must precisely match one of the folder names so not very "friendy").  If no ,/config/example has yet been chosen, it defaults to the first member of the candidates list.
    folder = simpledialog.askstring('Load Example', 'Enter example folder name:', initialvalue=current_example)

# Defining and Arranging Functional Groups of Controls/Displays



class ConfiguratorApp(tk.Tk):
    '''Main application class for the Marlin Configurator GUI.'''
    def __init__(self):
        logging.info('ConfiguratorApp __init__ started')
        super().__init__()

; super().__init__() calls the __init__ method of the parent class (tk.Tk in this case), initializing the base Tkinter application. This sets up the main window and all underlying Tkinter functionality needed for your GUI to work.

        logging.info('Tkinter __init__ started')
        self.title('Marlin Configurator')
        self.geometry('1280x1024')

# Loading a File into the Editor

One problem with the UI today, is that the process by which a file is loaded into the Editor and then displayed on the screen is doing at least 2 things it should not:

1. The file is NOT displayed from the beginning.  The first displayed line after loading is "way - down" in the actual file.
2. The display area starts in the right place, but then jumps up one line to hide the keywords field.

The process that loads the file is load_config_file():

    def load_config_file(self, file_path):
        '''Load the specified configuration file.'''
        logging.info(f'load_config_file called with file_path: {file_path}')
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                self.file_lines = f.readlines()  # <-- parses file into an array of lines
            self.base_lines = self.file_lines.copy()
            self.show_lines(self.file_lines)
            self.current_file_label.config(text=file_path)
        except Exception as e:
            messagebox.showerror('Error', f'Failed to load: {e}')
