## Philosophy

This structure follows the principle that users should be able to easily discover and understand the thought processes and decision-making which have gone into evolving the CR6Community Firmware and this repository, to its present state.

Breowsing the file structure in this folder will expose what type of initiatives have been explored.  Reading the documentation in each folder should reveal why the project was initiated, kwhat was done, and what was gained from the effort.

If a project generates product(s), those items will be stored in the appropriate folder(s) of this repository structure (e.g. analytical tools generated to support a project will be stored in the tools/analysis/<purpose> folder, to facilitate and encourage the discovery and reuse/repurposing of such tools, indepedently of the purpose and outcome(s) of their originating project.)
