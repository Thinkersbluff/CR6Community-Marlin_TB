# Welcome!


# Quick-Start Workflows:
These are the key steps we recommend you follow, in this order:

## 1. Decide whether you want to customize this firmware
No need to suffer the endless pain & confusion that is the life of a professional Software Developer (":wink:") if you don't need to know anything about compiling!  You may have much simpler alternatives.

## 2. Clone this Repository to Your Local Hard-Drive
Breathe! 
Stay with me! 
Step-by-step instructions follow, below.


### Step-by-step Instructions:
See!?

1. To just copy everything you need to your hard drive:

- Go to: [github.com/Thinkersbluff/CR6Community-Marlin_TB](https://github.com/Thinkersbluff/CR6Community-Marlin_TB)
- Click the green Code button
- Select Download ZIP
- Open your Downloads folder
- Right-click the file CR6Community-Marlin_TB-main.zip â†’ choose Extract Allâ€¦
- Choose where you want to keep the project (e.g., D:\Firmware)
- Open the folder: CR6Community-Marlin_TB-main\tools\configurator
- Open README.md in that folder for the next steps
ðŸ’¡ If Python, pip, or PlatformIO arenâ€™t installed yet, youâ€™ll also need them, to build the firmware.

2. To make a copy of the repository that you can keep up to date with the online version:

 - Install git on your system
 - Use git to clone this repository directly to your computer. 

This option allows you to easily keep your local copy up to date with the latest changes by running a simple git pull command in a terminal window. 

## 3. Install/Activate the Build Environment
### As a Firmware User:
No containers required.
Just install python and platformio globally 
AND use ./tools/configurator/configurator.py

### As a Firmware Developer:
Recommended: Use the containerized build environment (compose.yaml, Dockerfile), located in the root of the repository

Optionally: 
Linux/macOS: Install platformio and python on your platform and run the Bash shell scripts in a local terminal.

Windows: Install WSL2 and create your own docker-based build environment 
OR Use the Powershell scripts located at ./tools/windows_developers/build

## 4. Customize and build your own firmware.bin(s)

### As a Firmware User
If you prefer using GUI-based apps, you may find [**the CR6Community Marlin Configurator desktop gui app**](https://github.com/Thinkersbluff/CR6Community-Marlin_TB/blob/main/tools/configurator) to be exactly the tool you need.

If you prefer Command-Line Interfaces, you can install platformio and python locally and edit/run build-single.sh in a bash window.
